# ColourChooser

A simple colour chooser discord bot. Works by taking user-provided hex codes and created a role based on their user id, with the colour of the role being the hex code provided.

## Warning

A system like this will easily fill up your role menu, and is not recommended for large servers. This is a simple bot for small servers.

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a bot on the discord developer portal
4. Add the bot to your server
5. Copy the `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env`, then fill in the token field with your bot token from the discord developer portal
6. Run the bot with `python main.py`

## Usage
